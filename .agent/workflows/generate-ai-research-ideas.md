# AI Research Autopilot

Follow these steps to generate and refine a high-quality AI research idea automatically:

1. **Idea Generation**: 
   - Use the `ai-research-innovator` skill to analyze the code/file at hand.
   - Generate 3-5 original, mathematically-grounded ideas with accessible explanations.

2. **Autonomous Selection & Review**: 
   - Identify the most promising idea from the list (highest novelty and impact potential).
   - Immediately use the `idea-reviewer` skill to critique this specific idea based on Novelty, Feasibility, Impact, Math Rigor, and Alignment.

3. **Autonomous Refinement**: 
   - Take the reviewer's critique and use the `idea-revisor` skill.
   - Address the gaps found during review and generate a "V2" of the proposal.
   - Ensure the final math is robust and the explanation is social-media ready.

4. **Final Output**: 
   - Present the finalized "V2" research proposal as the final result. 
   - Do not wait for user input between steps or log to external files.
